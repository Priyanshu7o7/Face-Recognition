# Face-Recognition
Python Project

Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a real-time face recognition-based attendance system developed using Python's OpenCV and face_recognition libraries. The system captures video through a webcam, processes frames to detect and recognize faces, and logs the attendance of recognized individuals into a CSV file.

Key Features:

Real-time face recognition from video input.
Adjustable frame rate and resolution settings for optimal performance.
Detection and encoding of known faces from images.
Logging of recognized faces with timestamps into a CSV file.
The project demonstrates the integration of computer vision and facial recognition technologies to automate attendance recording, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
